# RiOpen
RiOpen is a simple mod for Potion Craft which starts each new day with your shop closed, allowing you to choose whether or not to open for the day.

<h2>How to use</h2>
Simply wake up in the morning and if you want to open up, go to the front of your shop and click on the calendar button above your inventory. Otherwise, no customers will spawn and you will be free to sleep again at any time. Once you open shop, you are unable to sleep until all customers are dismissed.

I've decided to use the calendar button for convenience, and because once the official calendar is implemented into the game this mod will either be obsolete or need be heavily reworked to fit into it.

<h2>Requirement: Installing BepInEx 5</h2>

This mod uses [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)!
Download the latest version from the link above. If needed, follow the BepInEx [Install Guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_mono.html).
In short: 
1. Extract the BepInEx zip into your Potion Craft root directory (probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Potion Craft`)
2.  Run your game once to allow BepInEx to perform its setup


<h2>The easy part: Installing RiOpen</h2>

1. [Download](https://github.com/ColoursRi/RiOpen/releases/tag/v1.0.0) the mod, and simply place `RiOpen.dll` in `PotionCraft/BepInEx/Plugins`
